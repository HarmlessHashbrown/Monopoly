This programs is the recreation of the game called Blue marble as known as Monopoly for english speakers. I made this program as monopoly is one of my favorite board game yet has a big disadvantage of being to big to bring around. To solve this I wanted to make this on computer as it takes up less space and weight to bring around.

When the roll button is clicked, it opperates the dice code which sends its value(in this case a 5)to the character function, the character function then adds the current value of the dice and the previous value from player info. When the total amount exeeds the multiples of 7 it makes a turn allowing it to move in a square direction.
